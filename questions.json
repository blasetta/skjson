TensorFlow Extended (TFX) is specifically designed and recommended by Google for these large-scale, end-to-end ML workflows, especially for structured data and text, but its components are also highly effective for managing large-scale image data pipelines. TFX provides a robust, standardized set of components for each step, which integrates seamlessly with Dataflow for scalable processing and Vertex AI for training and orchestration. This is the most complete and standardized solution for the described problem. \n\nOfficial Documentation: [TFX on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/tfx-on-google-cloud)",

While you could build this pipeline with KFP, you would be re-implementing much of the standardized functionality that TFX provides out-of-the-box (like data validation, schema generation, etc.), leading to more custom code. \nD: MLFlow is primarily a tool for experiment tracking and model management, not a full-fledged pipeline orchestration framework like TFX or KFP."

The scenario describes a 'memory-intensive' process where failures occur while CPU usage is still moderate. This strongly suggests that the model is running out of memory and crashing before the CPU load gets high enough to cross the default autoscaling threshold (e.g., 60%). By *decreasing* the CPU utilization target (e.g., to 30%), you make the autoscaler more sensitive. It will trigger the creation of a new node much earlier, effectively distributing the memory load across more machines before any single machine becomes memory-exhausted. \n\nOfficial Documentation: [Scaling options for model deployments](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/scaling#autoscaling-parameters)",

This is the key to providing access without making users overly powerful. 4. **Notebooks Role**: A role like `Notebooks Runner` or `Notebooks Admin` is needed at the project level for users to be able to start, stop, and connect to the instance itself.

It is often overly permissive and is shared across many resources, making it difficult to enforce the principle of least privilege. \nC: Granting the `Editor` role to team members is overly permissive and a major security risk. It gives them broad permissions across the entire project, far exceeding what is needed to use a single notebook. \nD: Running a shared resource under a single user's personal account is bad practice for security and manageability.

This causes the component's definition to be different on every single run, which in turn generates a new, unique hash. As a result, the cache is never hit. By giving the deterministic steps (export, preprocess) static, unchanging names, you ensure their definition remains constant. As long as their inputs also remain constant, the cache will be correctly utilized, saving significant time and cost. \n\nOfficial Documentation: [Caching in Vertex AI Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/caching)",

This is the key to providing access without making users overly powerful. 4. **Notebooks Role**: A role like `Notebooks Runner` or `Notebooks Admin` is needed at the project level for users to be able to start, stop, and connect to the instance itself. This combination is secure, manageable, and follows least privilege. \n\nOfficial Documentation: [Grant a user access to a user-managed notebooks instance](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/grant-access)",

It is often overly permissive and is shared across many resources, making it difficult to enforce the principle of least privilege. \nC: Granting the `Editor` role to team members is overly permissive and a major security risk. It gives them broad permissions across the entire project, far exceeding what is needed to use a single notebook. \nD: Running a shared resource under a single user's personal account is bad practice for security and manageability.

If the hash matches a previous execution, the cached result is used. A common mistake is to dynamically generate component names (e.g., `f'preprocess-{timestamp}'`). This causes the component's definition to be different on every single run, which in turn generates a new, unique hash. As a result, the cache is never hit. By giving the deterministic steps (export, preprocess) static, unchanging names, you ensure their definition remains constant. As long as their inputs also remain constant, the cache will be correctly utilized, saving significant time and cost. \n\nOfficial Documentation: [Caching in Vertex AI Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/caching)",
